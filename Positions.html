<p>  There are 2 main roles in basketball, <em>bigs</em> and <em>guards</em> however each role have different positions inside them.
    <img src="Positions.png">
    <br><br><strong>Guards</strong>
    <br><em>Point Guard</em>
    <br>The Point Guard(PG) or number 1 leads the offence, they bring the ball up the court and make plays for their team. The PG is typically the teams shortest player but has the best ball handling and passing skills. A good PG requires you to be quick, good at driving in and good at short range shots. You should be able to create shot opportunities for youself and teamates too. PGs can make buckets outside the three 3 however majority of their shots will be inside the three line.
    <br><em>Shooting Guard</em>
    <br>The Shooting Guard(SG) or number 2 is as the name suggests the "shooter" of the team, often shooting 3s and long mid range shots. There main goal is to try and get open while the rest of the team passes the abll around, once they get open they can recieve the ball and shoot the ball. A good SG requires good shooting skills from all around the court, the ability to move around and see opportunities to get open, and to communicate with the team when open.
    <br><br><strong>Bigs</strong>
    <br><em>Small Forward</em>
    <br>The Small Forward(SF) or number 3 is the most versitile postion on the court. The SF is like the "swiss army knife" because they can do just about everything, from scoring, to rebounding, handling the ball, passing and the ability to defend. A SF should be good at "getting to the line" and drawing fouls by agressivley attemping plays, layups or slam dunks. Hence they should be good at shooting free throws because this is where they get most of their points.
    <br><em>Power Forward</em>
    <br>The Power Forward(PF) or number 4 is often plays a similar role to the center. The PF is often the most powerful player and dependable scorer on the team. THey should be be able to score close to the bucket while also being able to shoot mid range shots about 10-15 feet away from the rim. PF are also very crafty and also have to be very versatile on both offence and defence. On defence, they should have the strength to guard bigger players close to the hoop while also haveing the athleticism to defend quick players away from the rim.
    <br><em>Center</em>
    <br>The Center(C) or number 5 is usually the largest player on the team, the C typically plays near the baseline or close to the hoop. A good C should be good at jump balls, getting rebounds, contesting shots, and setting screens for teammates. The Centers goal is to create possesions and therefore opputuniteies to score, by rebounding and defending the other team from scoring in the pain.
