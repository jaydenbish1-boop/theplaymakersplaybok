<p>The basketball court is a very recognisable court, however with all the different lines it can be very confusing.

    <br>
    <strong>Layout</strong>
    <br>The basketball court is a rectanguular court with a half way line, 2 baselines on each side, with two 10 foot hoops above them. Each hoop has a three line surrounding it. The half circle underneath the rim is a restricted area, its implemented so defending plkayers cant stand there and drawing an offensive foul, this area also allows offensive players to freely drive in without daring an unfair foul, it also reduces the amount of injury and collisions in the paint. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>3 Line</strong>
    <br>The 3 line has 3 main positions a player can stand, <em>Top of the key</em> which is directly in front of the rim. Then the <em>Corner</em> which is directly adjacent to the rim so there isnt a backboard. And finally the <em>Wing</em> which is in between the top of the key and the corner. All of these are still worth 3 points even if the corncer is harder than the wing. However shooting from the corner does give you aura points because your are basically forced to swish the ball.
    <br><br>
    <strong>The Paint</strong>
    <br>The box area in front of the rim is called the "paint", offensive players are limited to only 3 seconds in this area. Defence players can also draw a violation for spending more than 3 seconds in the paint if they arent actively guarding an opponent. The paint exists to prevent players form camping in the paint, which encourages movement and spacing on offense. The three second counts as soon as an offensive players feet are inside the paint, the count resets when the player has both feet completely outside the area.
